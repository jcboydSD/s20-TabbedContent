                    <h3>What is it?</h3>
                    <h4>Coronavirus</h4>
                    <p>A coronavirus is a type of virus that commonly causes mild upper-respiratory tract illnesses. In late 2019, a new coronavirus appeared in Wuhan, Hubei Province, China. This is a "novel coronavirus," a coronavirus that has not been previously identified. Prior to the outbreak, no human had any immunity, because the presence of this virus in humans is new. This novel coronavirus was named SARS-CoV-2. People who are infected with this novel coronavirus may recover or may develop the disease now labeled as COVID-19.</p>
                    <h4>COVID-19</h4>
                    <p>COVID-19 is a disease caused by the novel coronavirus SARS-CoV-2. The main symptoms for those with COVID-19 are fever, cough, and difficulty breathing. These symptoms may appear 2 to 14 days after exposure to the coronavirus. Latest news indicates that it is possible for someone who has the virus but is asymptomatic to spread the virus which causes the disease.</p>

                    <h3>Who gets it?</h3>
                    <p>All humans are susceptible to the novel coronavirus. Unlike other coronaviruses that usually infect the elderly and the very young, SARS-CoV-2 is affecting people of all ages. Those who are 65 or older, or who have pre-existing medical conditions (such as heart disease, lung disease, or diabetes), seem to be at higher risk for developing COVID-19, and for having more severe cases of COVID-19. The numbers of infections and deaths go down with the age of the person infected with the virus. At present, the very young do appear to be as much at risk as with other viruses.<br><br>So far, it appears that the virus is spread by droplets from coughing or sneezing. An infected person who coughs can spread droplets to anyone within about 6 feet (or more depending on the flow of air). People nearby might breathe in the droplets, or touch them and then touch their faces. The droplets can remain suspended in the air for up to 3 hours. If the droplets land on cardboard, they may survive up to 24 hours. If they land on plastic or stainless steel, they can survive for 2-3 days, depending on conditions.<br><br>The virus is spreading very easily, and sustainably, meaning it goes from person to person without stopping. At first, it was possible to trace where and from whom people were infected. Now that there is general community spread of the virus throughout the world, tracing is much more difficult.</p>

                <div class="content" id="howMany">
                    <h3>How many are ill?</h3>
                    <p>The numbers are changing every day. At the beginning of April 2020, the number of confirmed cases in the world reached 1 million, and continues to rise rapidly. Just over a month later, in mid-May 2020, there were more than 4 million confirmed cases worldwide. As of May 13, 2020, more than 295,000 people have died from COVID-19 or complications from the disease. China was the first location or "hot spot" for the disease. Italy, Spain, the United Kingdom, and the United States followed, with the U.S. now leading the world with the number cases and the number of deaths.<br><br>If one person coughs and infects 3 people, then those 3 people infect 3 more each, that's 10 people infected from one cough. Without mitigation efforts, the numbers go up exponentially for numbers infected. At first, it appeared that infected people were spreading the virus to an average of 2.7 other people. If that rate drops below 1.0, the virus can be considered to be controlled, no longer running rampant in the world's human population.<br><br>Currently, the best way to slow the rate of infection (or virus transmission) is social distancing -- staying at least 6 feet away from other people. It is also critcally important to wash hands thoroughly and often with soap and water. For those who may be infected (anyone really), coughing or sneezing into their elbow or into a tissue can help limit the number of droplets in the air that can infect others.</p>

                    <h3>How is it affecting us?</h3>
                    <p>Since social distancing is so importing in limiting the transmission of the virus, rules have been enacted in many places that require people to practice social distancing with anyone not thier immediate household. Many schools briefly closed and then restarted online. Those that have reopened have done so with significant restrictions on in-person activities. Businesses and public places where people congregate have closed and only have been allowed to reopen with strict social distancing and sanitizing guidelines in place. At present, staying home is the new normal, with many people working or attending school from home. The closure of many businesses has led to record numbers of unemployed workers, with worldwide economic impacts.<br><br>Initially, there was a lot of panic buying when the virus first appeared in the U.S. Stores with empty shelves, especially for toilet paper, hand sanitizer, and sanitizing wipes, became commonplace. Grocery stores have limited purchases to only a few of these high-demand items to ensure widespread availability, and have added special shopping hours for older, at-risk individuals to shop. Many stores have shortened hours to close earlier, giving staff more time to restock empty shelves and to avoid contact with customers.</p>

                    <h3>When will it be over?</h3>
                    <p>The first outbreak in China lasted for about 3 months, but only with significant restrictions on public interactions and travel. As the restrictions have been relaxed, the virus has resurfaced causing a second wave to begin. International travel also threatens to reintroduce the virus in places where it may have been brought under control and restrictions have been relaxed.<br><br>Ultimately, the duration will depend a lot on who well people follow the guidelines that are helping to slow the transmission of the virus. To the extent that social distancing and sanitizing guidelines are ignored, the virus will infect increasing numbers of people once the virus has been introduced in an area of population.<br><br>Other factors that will determine the length of the current pandemic include how robust the testing and contact tracing capabilities become, whether a vaccine can be developed and rapidly deployed to the requisite number of people, and whether the virus remains stable in its current form (not more or less virulent to humans).</p>
